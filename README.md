# musictheory
**a small js project by mlodymrt**
## Information:
So I came up with the idea for this project about 10 minutes ago in my cs class as I'm writing this.
The main idea is for this to be a web app that helps you write music without learning music theory.
I want the site to let you pick between scales, then show notes and chords in that scale. 
I also want to add an option to select the genre of music that you're interested in and show popular chord progressions in the genre of choice.
I don't think I've seen a website/app like this before but that might be because I haven't really looked.
###I don't want the project to be a tool that doesn't teach.
I find learning music theory pretty hard and I think that having a tool like this might help you learn it faster.
When the app is gonna show you chords I'll make it so that it shows what sounds they're made out of *(for example: Cmaj = [C,E,G])* while also showing how they were made *(for example a major triad consists of the root note, root+4 and root+7)*. I plan on adding most popular chord types like Major, Minor, Dominant 7, sus2 and sus4.

<ins>Also keep in mind that I'm **NOT** a developer and this is a project I'm making for fun so expect bugs, glitches etc. If you find or have any constructive criticism you can contact me via discord (username in my bio). Help is always appreciated!</ins>

also I know this readme is pretty shit but it's my first time writing one (I'll learn I promise)
